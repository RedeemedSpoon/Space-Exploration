# Spatial Exploration Analysis

Hey folks,

You know how sometimes you stumble upon some cool space-related info and think, "Hey, this could be interesting to share"? That's pretty much what led me here. Over time, I found myself digging into data from [NextSpaceFlight](https://nextspaceflight.com/). Instead of keeping all these findings to myself, I figured I'd lay them out in a simple website. Think of it as a casual spot where I can share what I've uncovered and maybe spark a conversation or two.

## The Lowdown

Alright, so what's the deal with this site? Well, it's a bit of a side project, to be honest. I've used tools like Plotly and Pandas to sift through the data and visualize it. You'll find graphs, choropleths, and some other visual goodies. While I'm no expert, I've tried to make the information as accessible and Professional as possible. So whether you're just browsing or genuinely curious about space-related topics, there's something here to pique your interest.

## A Word of Caution

Before you dive too deep, let's set the record straight. This isn't some authoritative source on space exploration or anything like that. It's a passion project, driven by curiosity more than anything else. While I've done my best to present accurate information, remember that it's all done in the spirit of exploration and fun. So, take a look around, enjoy the visuals, and maybe you'll find something that resonates with your own fascination for the cosmos (although, this one is centered around historical data about space organisations more then anything else)
